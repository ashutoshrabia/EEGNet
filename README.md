# EEGNet
<p> ntent-based brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) represent a promising technology for enabling direct 
communication between the brain and external devices, particularly benefiting individuals with severe motor 
impairments.The P300 speller paradigm is a key application that detects the P300 event-related potential for 
character selection.  </p>
 <p> The primary aim of this project is to enhance the accuracy of P300 signal classification in intent-based 
brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) using advanced machine learning techniques. By leveraging a combination 
of traditional machine learning models and state-of-the-art neural network architectures, such as EEGNet and 
LMDA-Net, the project aims to improve the reliability and performance of BCIs for more effective 
communication and control applications.</p>
